## LinkList Directory

Contains an zero-direction link-list, which have two field:
1.  Head pointer of list `Node<T> *head`;
2.  Length of list `int length`;

However, this link-list act more like a array.

Also implement several methods:
1.  Empty constructor;
2.  Constructor that build a list from an array;
3.  Get length;
4.  Get value from a given position
5.  Get value's reference from a given position
6.  Add a value at end;
7.  Delete a value at end;
8.  Insert a value into a given position
9.  Delete a value at a given position 
10. Reverse list;
11. Destructor;
12. Overload [] operator;
13. Overload ostream;

## List Directory

Contains an list, which actually is a double-direction link-list;

List has three field:
1.  Size of list;
2.  Header of list;
3.  Trailer of list;

Protected method of List:
1.  Init method;
2.  Method which clear all element in list;
3.  Copy n nodes after p pointer;
4.  Merge;
5.  Merge sort;
6.  Selection sort;
7.  Insertion sort;
